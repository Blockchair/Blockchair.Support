### <a name="link_changelog"></a> Changelog

* v.2.0.29 - Jun 30th, 2019
    * The [State changes](#link_state) feature now supports requesting potential state changes caused by mempool transactions. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/mempool`. It's now possible to easily build an app watching for transactions incoming/outgoing to/from millions of addresses, see [an example](#link_state).
* v.2.0.28 - Jun 28th, 2019
    * Added support for Groestlcoin nodes. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/groestlcoin/nodes`. The `stats` endpoint (`https://api.blockchair.com/groestlcoin/stats`) now also shows the node count.
* v.2.0.27 - Jun 27th, 2019
    * Effective July 19th, there will be a new policy on using our Public API for both non-commercial and commercial projects. Please see [Applying for an API key first](#link_apikey) and apply for an API key before July 19th! Since this is a major compatibility-breaking change, `context.api.next_major_update` is set to `2019-07-19 18:07:19` (see [General Provisions](#link_generalprovisions))
    * Removed `ethereum.uncles.total_difficulty` column according to https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/19024
* v.2.0.26 - Jun 20th, 2019
    * Added `utxo` array showing available unspent transaction outputs for Bitcoin-like coins to the following endpoints:
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}`
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/addresses/{:address1}[,{:address2}…]`
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/xpub/{:[xyz]pub}`
      
      Each array element has the following structure:
        * `block_id` - block number (`-1` for unconfirmed outputs)
        * `transaction_hash` - transaction hash
        * `index` - output index in the transaction (also known as the `vout` number)
        * `value` - output value in satoshi
        * `address` (only for `addresses` and `xpub` dashboards) - showing the output owner
      
      This new functionality **DEPRECATES** usage of an old method to retrieve the UTXO set for an address, namely `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/outputs?q=recipient({:address}),is_spent(false)`. See the discussion with some examples here: https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/issues/192
    * The 3 above listed endpoints now also have a new way to iterate through the transaction list and the UTXO set. It's now possible to use `?limit=A,B` and `?offset=C,D` sections in the query. The first number affects the transaction list, the second number affects the UTXO set. If only one number is set, it affects both. The default `limit` is `100`. The maximum `limit` is `10000`. The default offset is `0`. The maximum offset is `1000000`. Here are some examples:
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}` - shows address data with an array of 100 latest transactions and 100 latest UTXOs
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}?limit=0` - if you require just some general stats like the address balance
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}?limit=0,100` - if you need just the general stats and the UTXO set
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}?limit=100,0` - if you need just the general stats and the transaction list
        * `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}?limit=100,0&offset=100,0` - ... and to iterate it
    * The `api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/block/{:hash}|{:id}` endpoint now also has an iterable set of transaction hashes included in the block. The default `limit` is `100`. The maximum `limit` is `10000`. The default offset is `0`. The maximum offset is `1000000`. This feature implements https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/issues/189
* v.2.0.25 - Jun 19th, 2019
    * Added Groestlcoin support (it has SegWit support, so all API functionality available for Bitcoin and Litecoin is available for Groestlcoin as well).
    * Added `suggested_transaction_fee_per_byte_sat` key to `{:chain}/stats` calls. This value shows a good enough approximation of an optimal fee value suggested by our engine based on the current mempool state (in satoshi per byte) to get into the next block. Please note that for transactions less important for you this fee suggestion may be too high, while for very important transactions it may not be enough if you'll get unlucky because of the lack of new blocks. Supported for all coins except for Ripple and Ethereum for which we'll have a separate value suggesting an appropriate gas price value.
    * Updated xpub support to v.b5 (see `xpub support` in the docs: two bugs have been fixed); 
* v.2.0.24 - Jun 6th, 2019
    * Added an optional `countdowns` array to `{:chain}/stats` calls. If present, this array contains information about various upcoming events such as hard forks or reward halvings. There are two keys for each event: `event` which contains event description, and `time_left` showing how many seconds are left until the event occurs. Please note that the number of seconds is an approximate value because most events are triggered after a block at a specific height is mined, and since it's not possible to know for sure when a block becomes mined, we can only approximate that.
* v.2.0.23 - May 24th, 2019
    * Added support for Dash nodes. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/dash/nodes`. The `stats` endpoint (`https://api.blockchair.com/dash/stats`) now also shows the node count.
    * It's now possible to query Dash xpubs (see `xpub support` in the docs)
    * Dash is now out of beta on our platform
* v.2.0.22 - May 23rd, 2019
    * The state changes feature introduced in v.2.0.20 is now available for Ethereum. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/state/changes/block/{:block_id}`. Please note that it shows only the balance changes caused by a block. Values are returned as strings because some wei values don't fit into int64.
    * Some optimizations to the Ethereum mempool processing - we now show a lot more unconfirmed transactions
* v.2.0.21 - Apr 22nd, 2019
    * We've added an ability to query multiple addresses at once. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/addresses/{:addr1},{:addr2},...` (supported for BTC, BCH, LTC, DASH, BSV, and DOGE). E.g., now, if you need to retrieve information about 3 different addresses, you wouldn't need to make 3 separate queries, you'd need to query just `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/dashboards/addresses/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa,12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX,1HLoD9E4SDFFPDiYfNYnkBLQ85Y51J3Zb1`. The response contains information on the set of addresses (total balance, total transaction count, etc.), information about each address, and the list of the latest 100 transactions for this set (iterable with `&offset=N`). The maximum number of addresses in one query is 100 (higher limits are available for our premium users). Querying multiple addresses at once works much faster (e.g. it's almost 95 times faster to query 100 addresses via the new endpoint compared to making separate requests).
* v.2.0.20 - Apr 19th, 2019
    * Now it's possible to query state changes caused by a block for all chains we support except for ETH. The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/block/{:block_id}`. The response contains an array where the keys are addresses which were affected by the block, and the values are balance changes. Example: `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/1` returns `12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX => 5000000000` which means that the only state change caused by this block was rewarding the miner with 50 bitcoins. This is useful if you need to track balance changes for a lot of addresses - you can now simply track state changes and find the needed addresses there instead of constantly retrieving information about the balances.
* v.2.0.19 - Apr 17th, 2019
    * Added alpha support for Ripple (see `Ripple support` in the docs)
    * Introducing Graph API for Ethereum (a possibility to find connections between two Ethereum addresses), see `Ethereum graph` in the docs) - it's in private alpha test mode
    * If you're constantly hitting Error 402 (i.e. by making too many requests per minute to our free API), you'll now receive Error 429 which means that your IP is banned for an hour. Not honoring our limits may result in a permanent ban
    * Fixed a couple of minor bugs in our Ethereum engine. We'll be rolling out an updated engine the next week, there shouldn't be any compatibility breaking changes
* v.2.0.18 - Apr 2nd, 2019
    * Added biggest transactions over the last 24h to `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/stats` calls (`largest_transaction_24h` key);
    * Updated xpub support to v.b3 (see `xpub support` in the docs, there are some breaking changes); 
    * Updated aggregation support to v.b4 (see `Data aggregation support` in the docs)
    * We're **DEPRECATING** usage of unsupported parameters in GET and POST requests to our API endpoints (e.g. `https://api.blockchair.com/stats?myarbitrarykey=1234` might result in a `400 Bad Request` error);
    * Previously DEPRECATED API v.1 has been shut down
    * Previously DEPRECATED undocumented `?export=` functionality now requires an API key (apply at <`info@blockchair.com`>) for everything except:
        * Aggregated results
        * `blocks` and `mempool/*` tables across all blockchains we support
* v.2.0.17 - Mar 14th, 2019
    * Added support for Bitcoin SV nodes, they are now separate from Bitcoin Cash nodes. Endpoint: `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin-sv/nodes`.
* v.2.0.16 - Mar 13th, 2019
    * Added support for ypub and zpub for Bitcoin and Litecoin in test mode. See `xpub support` in the docs.
* v.2.0.15 - Mar 12th, 2019
    * Added Dash support in test mode. We're supporting all the features for DASH as we support for other Satoshi-like coins. Additional columns: `blocks.cbtx`, `transactions.type` (possible types: `simple`, `proregtx`, `proupservtx`, `proupregtx`, `prouprevtx`, `cbtx`, `qctx`, `subtxregister`, `subtxtopup`, `subtxresetkey`, `subtxcloseaccount`), `transactions.is_instant_lock`, `transactions.is_special` (`true` for all transaction types except `simple`), `transactions.special_json` (contains special transaction data encoded in json). E.g.: `https://api.blockchair.com/dash/blocks`
* v.2.0.14 - Mar 6th, 2019
    * Added xpub support in test mode. There's now support for retrieving info about multiple addresses using xpub keys. Use `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/xpub/{xpub}`. See `xpub support` in the docs.
    * Extended data aggregation abilities (still in test mode), see `Data aggregation support` in the docs. Now it's possbile to find correlations with price, and use special functions (e.g. to calculate SegWit adoption). 
    * We're **DEPRECATING** API v.1 and will be shutting it down on April 1st, 2019.
    * We're **DEPRECATING** undocumented `?export=` functionality when exporting large datasets without an API key. This feature will be documented in one of the next updates.
    * Full support for `CREATE2` in Ethereum (see `https://blockchair.com/ethereum/calls?q=type(create2)#`)
    * When using CSV/TSV API (undocumented `?export=` functionality) amounts in USD are now shown as in the JSON API version (previously you had to divide them by 10000). `bitcoin.outputs.type`, `ethereum.transaction.type`, and `ethereum.calls.type` now yield strings (e.g. `pubkeyhash` instead of `2`).
* v.2.0.13 - Feb 13th, 2019
    * Added support for Cyrillic characters in fulltext search, e.g. `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/outputs?q=script_bin(~привет)`
* v.2.0.12 - Feb 12th, 2019
    * Fixed a bug in Ethereum where some contract creations were erroneously shown as failed (thanks Daniel Luca for noticing) 
* v.2.0.11 - Feb 5th, 2019
    * We're changing behavior of our `mempool` tables (for all supported coins except for Ethereum): now they don't contain the contents of the latest block (it was quite a clumsy thing to have both mempool transactions and transactions from the latest block in this table, but we've rebuilt our engine, so now `mempool` tables contain mempool content only, and it finally makes sense!). That means:
        * `{chain}/mempool/blocks` is deprecated. Hint: if you used `mempool/blocks` to get info about the latest block you can simply switch to using `blocks?limit=1`, e.g. `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?limit=1`
        * `{chain}/mempool/transactions` and `{chain}/mempool/outputs` now don't contain info from the latest block, while `{chain}/transactions` and `{chain}/outputs` do
        * Before this update when using (undocumented) `export` functionality there was no information about the latest block at all, now there is
        * The same change to Ethereum will come in one of the next updates
    * Dogecoin is out of beta.
    * Bitcoin SV is out of beta. Please note there's still a possibility that we won't be able to offer some functionality in the long term if blocks suddenly become larger than 1 exabyte, we're still waiting for a more clear development roadmap.
* v.2.0.10 - Jan 29th, 2019
    * Added Dogecoin support in test mode
* v.2.0.9 - Dec 13th, 2018
    * Added Bitcoin SV support in test mode; updated [aggregation abilities](#data-aggregation-support-since-oct-8th)
* v.2.0.8 - Nov 26th, 2018
    * Added the ability to retrieve raw transaction data in hex, see [Retrieving raw transactions](#retrieving-raw-transactions)
* v.2.0.7 - Nov 22th, 2018
    * Now it's possible to broadcast transactions using our API, see [Broadcasting transactions](#broadcasting-transactions)
* v.2.0.6 - Oct 8th, 2018
    * Added data aggregation of blockchain data in beta mode, see `Data aggregation support` below
* v.2.0.5 - Oct 8th, 2018
    * Fixed bug where `balance` and `received` for bitcoin[-cash]|litecoin addresses in the `{chain}/dashboards/address/{address}` call were calculated wrong if there were specific unconfirmed transactions
* v.2.0.4 - Oct 3rd, 2018
    * Added some new useful fields to `{chain}/stats` calls
* v.2.0.3 - Sep 18th, 2018
    * Added `context.api.tested_features` with the list of features our API supports, but with no guarantee for backward compatibility if updated. Added Omni Layer and Wormhole support in testing mode (see the "Tested features changelog" below)
* v.2.0.2 - Sep 9th, 2018
    * Added `address.contract_created` to the `ethereum/dashboards/address/{A}` call
* v.2.0.1 - Sep 1st, 2018
    * Added Litecoin support

### <a name="link_testedfeatureschangelog"></a> Tested features changelog

##### Ripple support (since Apr 17th 2019)

* v.a1 - Apr 17th - Added alpha support for Ripple. We're not releasing the documentation for API yet, but we begin using it in our front end ourselves. If you're interested in participating in alpha test, drop us a line at <`info@blockchair.com`>

##### Ethereum graph (since Apr 17th 2019)

* v.a1 - Apr 17th - It's now possible to find connections between two Ethereum addresses using our API. Please note that since it's a resource consuming feature, it's available to our Private API users only (if you're interested in participating in alpha test, drop us a line at <`info@blockchair.com`>)

##### xpub support (since Mar 6th 2019)

* v.b5 - Jun 19th
    * Added support for Groestlcoin
    * Fixed a bug where some addresses were missing if there were huge gaps between used address (according the BIP44 / BIP32 standards the maximum gap is currently set to 20). Thanks to the Groestlcoin team for providing us with some great xpub examples.
    * Fixed a bug where some of xpubs containing a very large set of addresses (>100) returned a 500 error.
* v.b4 - May 24th
    * Added support for Dash
* v.b3 - Apr 2nd
    * Fixed a bug where unconfirmed balance didn't show up for xpubs
    * Some optimizations to the address calculation process have been made, now response is generated 2.5-3x times faster
    * Breaking change: paths for ypub, zpub (and possibly in the future for ltub, etc.) now all start with `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/xpub/`, i.e. to use ypub functionality you'll need to use `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/xpub/{ypub}` instead of `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/ypub/{ypub}`
* v.b2 - Mar 13th - We're bringing support for ypub and zpub as well (for Bitcoin and Litecoin). The endpoints are `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/ypub/{ypub}` and `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/zpub/{zpub}` (where `{chain}` is one of these: `bitcoin`, `litecoin`)
* v.b1 - Mar 6th - There's now support for retrieving info about multiple addresses using xpub keys. Use `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/xpub/{xpub}` (where `{chain}` is one of these: `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-cash`, `litecoin`, `bitcoin-sv`, `dogecoin`, e.g. `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/dashboards/xpub/xpub6CUGRUonZSQ4TWtTMmzXdrXDtypWKiKrhko4egpiMZbpiaQL2jkwSB1icqYh2cfDfVxdx4df189oLKnC5fSwqPfgyP3hooxujYzAu3fDVmz`). The response contains following keys:
    * `xpub` - information about group of addresses, including its current balance (`xpub.balance`)
    * `addresses` - array of addresses (returns the same schema as `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/dashboards/address/{addr}` with two exceptions: there's no `transaction_count` key, and there's `path key` showing xpub path)
    * `transactions` - hashes of the latest transactions, iterable using `?offset=N` 

##### Data aggregation support (since Oct 8th 2018)

* v.b4 - Apr 2nd - Fixed a bug where some usd values under functions when exporting to TSV/CSV were multiplied by 10000. Use `&export=tsv` or `&export=csv` to export the dataset into the corresponding format, e.g.: `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?a=date,avg(fee_usd)&q=time(2019-01-01..2019-04-01)&export=tsv` 
* v.b3 - Mar 6th
    * New function `price({ticker1}_{ticker2})` which shows the price if `date` (or one of: `week`, `month`, `year`) is also applied. E.g. it's now possible to build a chart showing correlation between price and transaction count: `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?a=month,sum(transaction_count),price(btc_usd)`. Supported tickers: usd, btc, bch, bsv, eth, ltc, doge.
    * Output values now have correct types (e.g. `sum(transaction_count)` is now integer instead of string).
    * Now it's possible to use special functions and applying special filters to them. Two examples:
        * `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?a=date,f(sum(witness_count)/sum(transaction_count))&q=time(2017-08-24..)` - calculate SegWit adoption
        * `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/outputs?a=date,f(count()/count())&q=type(nulldata),time(2019-02)&aq=0:0` - calculate the percentage of nulldata outputs: the `?aq=0:0` section applies 0th condition to 0th function (NB: after that 0th condition isn't used in the `WHERE` clause)
* v.b2 - Dec 12th - Now it's possible to apply `?limit=` and `?offset=` sections to aggregated queries. `context.total_rows` now shows how many aggregated results are there, and `context.rows` shows how many are shown.
* v.b1 - Oct 8th - Bringing the ability to obtain aggregated data. Now you can use Blockchair not only to filter and sort blockchain data, but also to aggregate it.

Please don't use this in production yet, there could be massive changes!

See the examples:
* https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?a=year,count()# - get the total number of Bitcoin blocks by year
* https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?a=month,median(fee_usd)# - get the median Bitcoin transaction fees by month
* https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/blocks?a=miner,sum(generation)&s=sum(generation)(desc)# - get the list of Ethereum miners (except uncle miners) and sort it by the total amount minted
* https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks?a=sum(fee_total_usd)&q=id(478559..)# - calculate how much miners have collected in fees since the fork
    
To use aggregation, put the fields by which you'd like to group by (zero, one, or several), and fields (at least one) which you'd like to calculate using some aggregate function under the `?a=` section. You can also sort the results by one of the fields included in the `?a=` section (`asc` or `desc`) using the `?s=` section, and apply additional filters (see the documentation for the `?q=` section).

Possible fields:
* Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Dash, Groestlcoin:
    * Blocks table
        * Group by: date (or week, month, year), version, guessed_miner

##### Omni Layer and Wormhole support (since Sep 18th 2018)

* v.a1 - Sep 18th - Added alpha support for Omni Layer in Bitcoin (`bitcoin/omni/properties`, `bitcoin/omni/dashboards/property/{id}` calls, plus `_omni` key in the `bitcoin/dashboards/transaction` call and `_omni` key in the `bitcoin/dashboards/address` call), and support for Wormhole in Bitcoin Cash (`bitcoin-cash/wormhole/properties`, `bitcoin-cash/wormhole/dashboards/property/{id}` calls, plus `_wormhole` key in the `bitcoin-cash/dashboards/transaction` call and `_wormhole` key in the `bitcoin-cash/dashboards/address` call). Please don't use this in production yet, there will be massive changes!

### <a name="link_generalprovisions"></a> General Provisions

* Requests to our server should be made through the HTTPS protocol by GET requests to the domain `api.blockchair.com`

* The server response returns a JSON array always consisting of two subarrays:
	* `data` - contains some data
	* `context` - contains metadata, e.g., a status code, a query execution time, and so on.
	
* `data` can contain either an associative array (e.g., for `bitcoin/stats`), or for infinitable-queries (see below) - an unnumbered array (for example, `bitcoin/blocks`), or for dashboard-queries (see below) - an associative array with keys which are parts of the query (e.g., for `bitcoin/dashboards/transactions/A,B`, the keys are `A` and `B`), and with values - arrays of data.
* `context`, depending on the call type, can contain the following useful values:
	* `context.code` - server response code, can return:
		* `200` if the request succeeds
		* `400` if there is a user error in the request
		* `402` if any limit on the number or complexity of requests is exceeded (see the restrictions below, please contact us at <info@blockchair.com> for private API access)
		* `500` or` 503` in case of a server error (it makes sense to wait and repeat the same request or open a ticket at https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/issues/new or write to <info@blockchair.com>)
	* There is a field `context.error` with an error description in the case of` 40x` and `50x` errors
	* `context.state` contains the number of the latest block in case of requests to the blockchains (for example, for all requests beginning with `bitcoin` there will be the latest block number for Bitcoin). It is useful in order, e.g., to calculate the number of network сonfirmations, or correctly iterate trough the results using `offset`
	* `context.results` - contains the number of found results for dashboard-calls
	* `context.limit` - applied limit to the number of results
	* `context.offset` - applied offset
	* `context.rows` - contains the number of returned rows for infinitable-calls 
	* `context.pre_rows` - for some infinitable-calls contains the number of rows that should've been returned before duplicate removal (note: this architecture is used for the `bitcoin[-cash].outputs` tables only)
	* `context.total_rows` - number of rows that a query returns
	* `context.api` - an array of data on the status of the API:
		* `context.api.version` - version of API
		* `context.api.last_major_update` - time of the last update, that somehow broke backward compatibility
		* `context.api.next_major_update` - time of the next scheduled update, that can break compatibility, or` null`, if no updates are scheduled
		* `context.api.tested_features` - the list (comma-separated) of features with version numbers our API supports, but with no guarantee for backward compatibility if updated (in this case there will be no changes to `context.api.next_major_update` as well)
		* `context.api.documentation` - an URL to the latest version of documentation

Note: it makes sense to check `context.api.version` and, if `context.api.next_major_update` is not `null`, notify yourself and review the changelog. If there are no changes in the changelog that violate the compatibility of your application, make sure that the value of `context.api.next_major_update` won't exceed the current one. If there are changes, adjust the application logic so, that after the specified time a new logic is applied. Additional note: in case the backward compatibility is violated only for one API call, then `context.api.next_major_update` won't be `null` just for this call.

* Request limits: as of now, we allow up to 30 requests per minute to our API. If this limit is exceeded, an error `402` will be returned. In case of abuse, your IP address can be blocked. If your application needs more requests, please contact us at <info@blockchair.com>. If you need to unload a large amount of information once, please contact us at <export@blockchair.com> and, in case the academic or research unloading goal - you will receive the data for free in a convenient format.

* Disclaimer: we do not guarantee the reliability or integrity of the provided information. Information provided by our API should not be used for making critical decisions. We do not guarantee an uptime for our free API.

#### <a name="link_apikey"></a> Please apply for an API key first

tl;dr:
* If you use our API occasionally a key is not required
* Non-commercial and academic projects constantly using our API should apply for a free Public API key
* Commercial projects should apply for a key to Premium API

Since the introduction of our API more than two years ago it has been free to use in both non-commercial and commercial cases with a limit of 30 requests per minute. Obtaining an API key has been required only for those who were hitting this limit.

**Beginning July 19th, 2019 we require all applications using our API to obtain an API key.**

If you develop a non-commercial project (e.g. a website showing some stats) or conducting academic research, please apply for a free key to our Public API (<info@blockchair.com>).

If you develop a commercial project (e.g. a web wallet showing ads), please apply for a key to our Premium API (<info@blockchair.com>).

While we still allow making requests without a key, services which make too many resource-consuming requests may automatically be banned (the API will return HTTP Error 430 in this case).

The key is applied to the end of the request string like this: `api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?key=MYSECRETKEY`. Please remember that your key is a secret -- don't disclose it to client-side applications as unauthorized users may start to use your key.

### <a name="link_infinitablecalls"></a> Infinitable Calls (blockhain tables)

Return data from the tables according to the filters (`q`), sorting (`s`), limit (`limit`), and offset (`offset`).

A request should be construced like this: `https://api.blockchair.com/{chain}/[/mempool]{table}[?q={query}][&s={sorting}][&limit={limit}][&offset={offset}]`

E.g. `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=size(1000000..)`

**Possible combinations of blockchains and tables:**
* Bitcoin:
    * `bitcoin/blocks` - contains all Bitcoin blocks, including the latest one
    * `bitcoin/transactions` - contains all Bitcoin transactions, excluding mempool transactions and transactions from the latest block   
    * `bitcoin/outputs` - contains all Bitcoin outputs, excluding the outputs contained in the mempool transactions as well as in the transactions from the latest block
    * `bitcoin/mempool/transactions` - contains Bitcoin mempool transactions
	* `bitcoin/mempool/outputs` - contains Bitcoin outputs included in mempool transactions
* Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Groestlcoin - the same as for Bitcoin
* Ethereum:
	* `ethereum/blocks` - contains all Ethereum blocks, except the last 6
	* `ethereum/uncles` - contains all Ethereum uncles, except those that belong to the last 6 blocks
	* `ethereum/transactions` - contains all Ethereum transactions, except transactions from the last 6 blocks
	* `ethereum/calls` - contains all transaction calls, except calls for the last 6 blocks
	* `ethereum/mempool/blocks` - contains the last 6 Ethereum blocks, some columns contain nulls
	* `ethereum/mempool/transactions` - contains all Ethereum transactions from the last 6 blocks as well as mempool transactions 

Notes: to speed up the process, our architecture contains separate tables (`mempool*`) for unconfirmed transactions, as well as for blocks that with a certain probability can be forked off from the main chain. For Ethereum, that's the latest 6 blocks plus the mempool. For Ethereum, we do not "replay" transactions entirely (i.e. not looking for internal calls) for the last 6 blocks, so there is no `mempool/calls` table.

**You can use filters** as follows: `?q=field(value)[,field(value)...]`, where `field` is the column by which a filter is needed, and `value` is a value, special value, or a range of values. The possible columns are listed in the tables below. Possible expressions for values:
* `value` - e.g., ` bitcoin/blocks?q=id(0)` finds information about block 0
* `left..` - non-strict inequality - e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(1..)` finds information about block 1 and above
* `left...` - strict inequality - e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(1...)` finds information about block 2 and above
* `..right` - non-strict inequality - e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(..1)` finds information about blocks 0 and 1
* `...right` - strict inequality - e.g.,` bitcoin/blocks?q=id(...1)` finds information only about block 0
* `left..right` - non-strict inequality - e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(1..3)` finds information about blocks 1, 2 and 3
* `left...right` - strict inequality - e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(1...3)` finds information only about block 2
* `~like` - occurrence in a string (`LIKE` operator), e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=coinbase_data_bin(~hello)` finds all blocks which contain `hello` in `coinbase_data_bin` 
* `^like` - occurrence at the beginning of a string (`STARTS WITH` operator), e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=coinbase_data_hex(^00)` finds all blocks for which` coinbase_data_hex` begins with `00`

For `time*`-fields, the value can be specified in the following formats:
* `YYYY-MM-DD HH:ii:ss`
* `YYYY-MM-DD`
* `YYYY-MM`

Inequalities are also supported for such values, but the left and right values must be in the same format, e.g.: `bitcoin/blocks?q=time(2009-01-03..2009-01-31)`.

If you need to list several filters, you need to sepatate them by commas in the `?q=` section, e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(500000..),coinbase_data_bin(~hello)`

We're currently testing support for `NOT` and `OR` operators (this may change in the future, including possible removal of these operators).

The operator `NOT` is comma-separated before the expression to be inverted, e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=not,id(1..)` returns the block `0`.

The `OR` operator is specified between the expressions and takes precedence (like it's when two expressions around `OR` are wrapped in parentheses), e.g., `bitcoin/blocks?q=id(1),or,id(2)` returns information about blocks 1 and 2.

Maximum guaranteed supported number of filters in one query: 5.

**Sorting** can be used as follows: `?s=field(direction)`, where `direction` can be either `asc` for sorting in ascending order, or `desc` for sorting in descending order, e.g. `bitcoin/blocks?s=id(asc)`

If you need to apply several sorts, you can list them by commas, similar to filters. The maximum guaranteed number of sorts is 2.

**Limit** is used like this: `?limit=N`, where N is a natural number from 1 to 100. The default is 10. In some cases `LIMIT` is ignored, and in such cases `context.limit` will be set to `NULL`.

**Offset** can be used as a paginator, e.g., `?offset=10` returns the next 10 results. `context.offset` takes the value of the set `OFFSET`. The maximum value is 10000. If you need just the last page, it's easier and quicker to change the direction of the sorting to the opposite. Important: when iterating through the results, it is extremely likely that the number of rows in the database will increase because new blocks were found. To avoid that, you may add an additional condition that limits the block id to the value obtained in `context.state` in the first query.

- the difference between `value_total` and `internal_value_total`: e.g., a transaction itself sends 0 eth, but this transaction is a call of a contract that sends someone, let's say, 10 eth. Then `value` will be 0 eth, and `internal_value` - 10 eth

- search by fields that contain values in wei (`generation`) can be with some inaccuracies
- the search over `extra_data_hex` column can be done by the operator `^`, you can also use `~` for `extra_data_bin` (however, the field `extra_data_bin` will still not be shown)
- sort by default - parent_block_id DESC

Additional synthetic columns (you can search over them and / or sort them, but they are not shown)

| Column | Type | Description | Q? | S? | 
|--------|------|-------------|----|----|
| input_bin | string `.*` | Text representation of input data. Allows you to use the `LIKE` operator: `?q=input_bin(~hello)` | + | |

Notes:

- (\*) - is always `null` for `mempool/transactions`
- (\*\*) - is always equal to `null` if `type` = `synthetic_coinbase`
- for the columns `id` and` hash` the increased efficiency at unloading of one record is applied
- there is no possibility to search over `date` column, you can search like `?q=time(YYYY-MM-DD)` instead
- search by fields that contain values in wei (`value`,` internal_value`) can be with some inaccuracies
- the search over `input_hex` column can be done by the operator `^`, you can also use `~` for `input_bin` (however, the field `input_bin` will still not be included in output)
- the difference between `value_total` and `internal_value_total`: e.g., a transaction itself sends 0 eth, but this transaction is a call of a contract that sends someone, let's say, 10 eth. Then `value` will be 0 eth, and `internal_value` - 10 eth
- the default sort is - id DESC
- possible types (`type`) of transactions:
    * call - the transaction transfers the value, but there are no more calls (a simple ether sending, not in favor of a contract, or the call to a contract that does nothing)
    * create - create a new contract
    * call_tree - the transaction calls a contract that makes some other calls
    * create_tree - create a new contract that create contracts or starts making calls
    * synthetic_coinbase - a synthetic transaction for awarding a reward to the miner (block or uncle)

#### <a name="link_ethereumcalls"></a> ethereum/calls

| output_hex (\*\*) | string `[0-9a-f]*` | Output call data | | |

Notes:

- (\*\*) - is always `null` if` type` = `synthetic_coinbase`
- for the column `transaction_id` increased efficiency when uploading one record is applied
- there is no possibility to search over `date` column, use searching `?q=time(YYYY-MM-DD)` instead
- search by fields that contain values in wei (`value`,` internal_value`) can be with some inaccuracies
- the default sort is transaction_id DESC
- sorting by `index` is alphabetical (ie "0.2" goes after "0.11"), in some cases a switch to natural sorting is used (for example, when there is a filter for `transaction_id`)

#### Notes

- for unconfirmed transactions (and outputs in the case of bitcoin[-cash]), the following rules are applied:
    - their `block_id` is equal to `-1`
    - `date` and` time` indicate the time when the transaction was received by our node
- when using `offset`, it is reasonable to add to the filters the maximum block number (`?q=block_id(..N)`), since it is very likely that during the iteration new rows will be added to the table. For convenience, you can take the value of `context.state` from the first result of any query containing the number of the latest block at the query time and use this result later on.

### <a name="link_dashboardcalls"></a> Dashboard calls

The API supports a number of calls that produce some aggregated data, or data in a more convenient form for certain entities.

#### <a name="link_block"></a> {chain}/dashboards/block/{A} and {chain}/dashboards/blocks/{A[,B,...]}

`{chain}` can be one of these: `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-cash`, `bitcoin-sv`, `litecoin`, `dogecoin`, `dash`, `ethereum`, `groestlcoin`

* `block` - information about the block in infinitable-format `(bitcoin[-cash]|ethereum)/blocks`
* `transactions` - the array of all hashes of transactions included in the block
* only for Ethereum - `synthetic_transactions` - array of internal ids of synthetic transactions (they do not have a hash) (`null` instead of the array until the block receives 6 confirmations)
* only for Ethereum - `uncles` - the array of hashes of the block's uncles (`null` instead of the array until the block receives 6 confirmations, in case there are no uncles and more than 6 confirmations - an empty array (`[]`))

`context.results` contains the number of found blocks.

* `transactions` - an array of the last 100 hashes the address is participating in

`context.results` contains the number of found addresses (0 or 1, until the `addresses` call is implemented).

To iterate `transactions`, `?offset=N` is supported.

#### <a name="link_ethereumaddress"></a> ethereum/dashboards/address/{A}

- (\*\*) - counted only those calls that fit the following condition: ethereum/calls.transferred = true (see the `ethereum/calls` documentation), i.e. those calls as well as failed calls that do not change state (staticcall, etc.) are not considered

#### <a name="link_chainstats"></a> {chain}/stats

* `bitcoin-cash/stats`
* `ethereum/stats`
* `litecoin/stats`
* `bitcoin-sv/stats`
* `dogecoin/stats`
* `dash/stats`
* `groestlcoin/stats`

### <a name="link_examples"></a> API request examples

Suppose we would like to receive all the latest transactions from the Ethereum blockchain which amount to more than $1M USD. The following request should be done for this:
* `https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/transactions?q=internal_value_usd(10000000..)&s=id(desc)`

In this request we refer to the blockhain (`ethereum`), a table (`transactions`), set up the amount condition (`q=internal_value_usd(10000000..)`), and sort in descending order (`&s=id(desc)`).

Suppose, a script with this request to the API for some reason did not work for a while, or a huge amount of transactions worth more than $1 million appeared. With the standard limit of 10 results, the script skipped some transactions. Then firstly we should do the following:
* `https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/transactions?q=internal_value_usd(10000000..)&s=id(desc)`

From its result we save `context.state`, put it in a variable `_S_`, and further to obtain the following results we apply `offset`:
* `https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/transactions?q=internal_value_usd(10000000..),block_id(.._S_)&s=id(desc)&offset=10`

Increase offset value until getting a data set with the transaction that we already knew about.

### <a name="link_broadcasting"></a> Broadcasting transactions

In order to broadcast a transaction into the network, you should make a POST request to `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/push/transaction` (where `{chain}` can be one of those: `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-cash`, `ethereum`, `litecoin`, `bitcoin-sv`, `dash`, `dogecoin`, `groestlcoin`) with `data` holding hex represenatation of a transaction (for Ethereum it should start with `0x`). An example:

```
curl -v --data "data=01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000" https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/push/transaction
```

If the transaction has been successfully broadcast to the network, API will return a JSON response (code 200) containing `data` array with `transaction_hash` key holding the hash of the received transaction. In case of any error (wrong transaction format, spending already spent outputs, etc.) API returns status code 400.

Example of a successful response:

```
{"data":{"transaction_hash": "0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098…"},"context":{"code":200,…
```

### <a name="link_raw"></a> Retrieving raw transactions

It's possible to get raw transaction data directly from our nodes. In order to do this you should make the following API call: `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/raw/transaction/{txhash}` (where `{:chain}` can be one of these: `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-cash`, `bitcoin-sv`, `litecoin`, `dogecoin`, `dash`, `ethereum`, `groestlcoin`)

The response contains two keys which are:
* `raw_transaction` - raw transaction represented as hex string
* `decoded_raw_transaction` (not available for Ethereum) - raw transaction encoded in JSON by our nodes. Please note that the structure of this JSON array may change as we upgrade our nodes, and this won't be reflected in our change logs.

### <a name="link_nodes"></a> Node list: {:chain}/nodes

Returns a list of full network nodes (except for Ethereum)

### <a name="link_state"></a> State changes

It's possible to query state changes caused by a block for all chains we support (except for Ripple).

The endpoint is `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/block/{:block_id)`.

The response contains an array where the keys are addresses which were affected by the block, and the values are balance changes.

Example: `https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/1` returns `12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX => 5000000000` which means that the only state change caused by this block was rewarding the miner with 50 bitcoins.

This is useful if you need to track balance changes for a lot of addresses - you can now simply track state changes and find the needed addresses there instead of constantly retrieving information about the balances.

Note: values are returned as strings for Ethereum.

It's also possible to query potential state changes caused by mempool transactions (this is not supported for Ethereum yet).

The endpoint for mempool state changes is `https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/mempool`.

Here's an example logic for an application watching for Bitcoin transactions incoming/outgoing to/from 1 million addresses:


```
latest_known_block_height = 0
addresses = [1Abc, 1Efg, 1Hij, ...]
while (true)
    api_response = api_request('https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/mempool')
    if any of api_response.data keys are in the addresses array
        print 'Found new transaction in the mempool'
    if latest_known_block_height < api_response.context.state // A new block has been mined (context.state always yields the latest block number)
    	// it’s possible that while you’re requesting a block multiple new blocks can be found
        for each block number {block} between latest_known_block_height and api_response.context.state do
            latest_known_block_height = block
            api_response_block = api_request('https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/{:block}')
            if any of api_response_block.data keys are in the addresses array
                print 'Found new transaction in the {block}th block'
    sleep(10) // The mempool data is cached for 10 seconds on our servers by default
```
